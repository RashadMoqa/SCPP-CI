These problems are Single Cylindrical Packing Problems with Cylindrical Items,      
the objective is to maximize the volume utilization of the container.

The format of these data files is:     
Number of test problems (100)     
For each problem p (p=1,...,100) the data has the format     
shown in the following example:

     Example:

     1              the problem number p
     110 587        container radius, height
     10             number of cylinder types n
     1 15 108 20
     2 12 110 11    where there is one line for each cylinder type
     3 ...................
     etc for n lines
     The line for each cylinder type contains 4 numbers:                         
     cylinder type i, cylinder radius, cylinder height, number of cylinders of type i
